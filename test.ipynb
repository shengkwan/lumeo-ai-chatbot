      "Based on the information provided from academic articles and economic research, one of the most adverse impacts of US tariffs imposed on other countries is a decline in global trade and increased economic uncertainty for many economies. Here are some key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Economic Uncertainty**: Tariffs can lead to significant uncertainty among businesses and investors about future trading conditions. This can result in reduced investment, delayed business decisions, and overall slower economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Revenue Impact**: For countries that heavily rely on exports to the US market, tariffs can significantly reduce their revenue streams. For example, South Korea and Japan faced increased tariffs on certain exports, which prompted negotiations for favorable trade agreements.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Economic Growth Impacts**: Tariffs can have direct effects on GDP growth. The J.P. Morgan Research analysis suggests that US tariffs could lower GDP growth estimates due to heightened trade policy uncertainty and the tax implications of these tariffs on households and businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Global Trade Disruption**: Tariffs often lead to retaliatory measures from other countries, potentially disrupting global supply chains and markets. This can cause disruptions in industries across various sectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Small and Vulnerable Economies**: The UNCTAD report highlights that small and vulnerable economies are disproportionately affected by tariffs, as they may have less ability to diversify their trade relationships or absorb the economic shocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "While specific adverse impacts might vary based on individual country's reliance on US markets and other factors, these general points provide a comprehensive view of how US tariffs can have significant adverse effects on global trade and economies.Goodbye!\n"

An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.'), Document(id='3842e83a-46f5-41ca-9a8c-df2b9be5ce23', metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/', 'start_index': 2578}, page_content='Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#'), Document(id='87e8a850-60eb-4e71-a5e5-df140dc92dd5', metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/', 'start_index': 19303}, page_content=\"(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results.

An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.'), Document(id='3842e83a-46f5-41ca-9a8c-df2b9be5ce23', metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/', 'start_index': 2578}, page_content='Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#'), Document(id='87e8a850-60eb-4e71-a5e5-df140dc92dd5', metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/', 'start_index': 19303}, page_content=\"(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results.
